    <h1>Homemade Rolls Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast (or 1 packet)</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (about 110°F or 45°C)</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup melted butter (plus extra for brushing)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk (for brushing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Stir to dissolve. Sprinkle the yeast
            over the top and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the yeast is frothy.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough: In a large mixing bowl, add the warm milk, melted butter, salt, and the egg. Stir to
            combine. Once the yeast mixture is ready, add it to the milk mixture. Gradually add the flour, about ½ cup
            at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon until it forms a dough. The dough should be soft but not too sticky.
            If needed, add a little more flour until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough: Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until it is smooth and
            elastic. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a
            warm place for 1-1.5 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Shape the rolls: Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into
            12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball by rolling it between your palms. Arrange the rolls in a
            greased 9x13 inch baking pan, leaving a little space between them.</li>
        <li>Second rise: Cover the pan with a kitchen towel and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes, or until
            they have puffed up and are touching each other.</li>
        <li>Bake: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the rolls for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown on top.
            Remove from the oven and brush with a little melted butter while they’re still warm.</li>
        <li>Serve: Let the rolls cool slightly before serving. Enjoy soft and fluffy homemade rolls with your favorite
            dish or as a standalone snack!</li>
